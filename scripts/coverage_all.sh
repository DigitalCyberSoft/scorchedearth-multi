# MERGED coverage: run all THREE V8 sources, then union them into one line% table.
#
#   1. NODE          vitest run --coverage  -> coverage/node/coverage-final.json (istanbul)
#   2. BROWSER-RENDER test-browser/run.mjs   -> coverage/browser-render/v8.json  (raw V8)
#   3. REAL-APP BOOT  test-browser/boot_cover.mjs -> coverage/boot/v8.json        (raw V8)
#   merge            scripts/coverage_merge.mjs  -> prints per-file + All-files line% table
#
# (2) and (3) share ONE vite DEV server (per-file /src/*.ts modules with inline
# sourcemaps -- REQUIRED so the raw V8 maps back to individual modules; `vite preview`
# serves a minified bundle with no per-module URLs).  The server is started in THIS
# shell (background + PID + trap) so it outlives the node drivers, and killed by PID.
# NEVER `pkill -f vite` -- it would self-match this script.
#
# The merge ALWAYS runs (the table is the deliverable); the script then exits non-zero
# iff any collector failed, so a real test/render/boot failure is not hidden.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/coverage_all.sh   (or: npm run coverage:all)
